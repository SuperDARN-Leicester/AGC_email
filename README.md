# AGC_email
This is a alert system for faults in the 16 Transmitters. It runs on a cronjob and will send out an email if any faults are detected with the transmitters or any transmitter fails to acknowledge the status request. This enables us to then ssh into the radar computer and find out a bit more about the problem byt using the AGC_Commander.
